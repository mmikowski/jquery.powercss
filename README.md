Avoid complex 'SPA framework' libraries 
---------------------------------------
jQuery, this, and  a few other well-chosen tools forms
a fantastic basis for a lean, easy to use SPA architecture
as detailed in [Single page web applications, JavaScript end-to-end][1].
Here are the recommended tools:

| Capability   | Tool                | Notes                             |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------|
| DOM + Util   | jQuery              | A powerful, stable, tight library |
| DynamicCSS   | PowerCSS            | This package                      |
| Websockets   | [Socket io][6]      | Prefer websockets over AJAX       |
| AJAX         | jQuery native       | Use jQuery AJAX methods           |
| Promises     | jQuery native       | Use jQuery promise methods        |
| Model Events | [Global Events][2]  | jQuery plugin eliminates having   |
|              |                     | to manage multiple event types    |
| Touch        | [Unified events][3] | Unify desktop and touch events    |
| Routing      | [uriAnchor][4]      | jQuery plugin for robust routing  |
|              |                     | Includes support for dependent    |
|              |                     | and independent query arguments   |
| Data Model   | [taffyDB][5]        | A powerful and flexible SQL-like  |
|              |                     | client data management tool       |
| SVG          | [D3][7]             | Great for easy graphs and charts  |
|              | [SVG][8]            | Low-level jQuery plugin           |
| Templates    | [Dust][9]           | Uses a powerful template DSL that |
|              |                     | minimizes chances to intemingle   |
|              |                     | business and display logic        |

This suite of tools has all the capabilities of a bleeding-edge 
SPA "framework" library within the reliable and mature jQuery ecosystem.
It can provide an application that is significantly more flexible and
testable since display logic can easily be decoupled from business logic.
Finally, it leverages jQuery's maturity, performance, and excellent
tools instead of competing with them.
