# PowerCSS by Michael S. Mikowski

## Overview
Unleash PowerCSS to create custom CSS for every user that visits your site. PowerCSS uses merging, caching, compression, and double-buffering to exceed the speed and flexibility of static CSS. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s

## Please see [PowerCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss)
This NPM namespace has been reserved for the jQuery PowerCSS implementation.
I do not expect to implement this until *after* the core 
[PowerCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss) package is complete.
At present, it appears this core implementation should play very well
with jQuery but will not depend on it.

Cheers, Mike
